# Deploy UserManagement Service with MySQL Database


## Step-01: Introduction
- We are going to deploy a **User Management Microservice** which will connect to MySQL Database schema **usermgmt** during startup.
- Then we can test the following APIs
  - Create Users
  - List Users
  - Delete User
  - Health Status 

| Kubernetes Object  | YAML File |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Deployment, Environment Variables  | 06-UserManagementMicroservice-Deployment.yml  |
| NodePort Service  | 07-UserManagement-Service.yml  |

## Step-02: Create following Kubernetes manifests

### Create User Management Microservice Deployment manifest
- **Environment Variables**

| Key Name  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| DB_HOSTNAME  | mysql |
| DB_PORT  | 3306  |
| DB_NAME  | usermgmt  |
| DB_USERNAME  | root  |
| DB_PASSWORD | dbpassword11  |  

### Create User Management Microservice NodePort Service manifest
- NodePort Service
- Port Explanation
nodePort: 31231
This is the external-facing port that is opened on every node in the cluster. External traffic can reach the service through this port on any node's IP address57. The nodePort range is typically between 30000 and 327675.
port: 8095
This is the internal port on which the Kubernetes service is exposed within the cluster68. Other pods or services within the cluster can communicate with this service using this port.
targetPort: 8095
This is the actual port on the pod where the application is running and listening for incoming traffic46. In this case, it's the same as the service port, but it could be different if the application inside the container uses a different port.
Traffic Flow
The traffic flow for this NodePort service configuration would be:
External client â†’ Node IP:31231
NodePort service receives traffic on port 31231
Service forwards traffic to internal port 8095
Traffic is then directed to targetPort 8095 on the selected pod(s)
This setup allows external access to the service while maintaining internal routing flexibility. It's particularly useful for development and testing scenarios, or when you need to expose services externally without using a load balancer35.

## Step-03: Create UserManagement Service Deployment & Service 
```
# Create Deployment & NodePort Service
kubectl apply -f kube-manifests/

# List Pods
kubectl get pods

# Verify logs of Usermgmt Microservice pod
kubectl logs -f <Pod-Name>

# Verify sc, pvc, pv
kubectl get sc,pvc,pv
```
- **Problem Observation:** 
  - If we deploy all manifests at a time, by the time mysql is ready our `User Management Microservice` pod will be restarting multiple times due to unavailability of Database. 
  - To avoid such situations, we can apply `initContainers` concept to our User management Microservice `Deployment manifest`.
  - We will see that in our next section but for now lets continue to test the application
- **Access Application**
```
# List Services
kubectl get svc

# Get Public IP
kubectl get nodes -o wide

# Access Health Status API for User Management Service
http://<EKS-WorkerNode-Public-IP>:31231/usermgmt/health-status
```

## Step-04: Test User Management Microservice using Postman
### Download Postman client 
- https://www.postman.com/downloads/ 
### Import Project to Postman
- Import the postman project `AWS-EKS-Masterclass-Microservices.postman_collection.json` present in folder `04-03-UserManagement-MicroService-with-MySQLDB`
### Create Environment in postman
- Go to Settings -> Click on Add
- **Environment Name:** UMS-NodePort
  - **Variable:** url
  - **Initial Value:** http://WorkerNode-Public-IP:31231
  - **Current Value:** http://WorkerNode-Public-IP:31231
  - Click on **Add**
### Test User Management Services
- Select the environment before calling any API
- **Health Status API**
  - URL: `{{url}}/usermgmt/health-status`
- **Create User Service**
  - URL: `{{url}}/usermgmt/user`
  - `url` variable will replaced from environment we selected
```json
    {
        "username": "admin1",
        "email": "dkalyanreddy@gmail.com",
        "role": "ROLE_ADMIN",
        "enabled": true,
        "firstname": "fname1",
        "lastname": "lname1",
        "password": "Pass@123"
    }
```
- **List User Service**
  - URL: `{{url}}/usermgmt/users`

- **Update User Service**
  - URL: `{{url}}/usermgmt/user`
```json
    {
        "username": "admin1",
        "email": "dkalyanreddy@gmail.com",
        "role": "ROLE_ADMIN",
        "enabled": true,
        "firstname": "fname2",
        "lastname": "lname2",
        "password": "Pass@123"
    }
```  
- **Delete User Service**
  - URL: `{{url}}/usermgmt/user/admin1`

## Step-05: Verify Users in MySQL Database
```
# Connect to MYSQL Database
kubectl run -it --rm --image=mysql:5.6 --restart=Never mysql-client -- mysql -h mysql -u root -pdbpassword11

# Verify usermgmt schema got created which we provided in ConfigMap
mysql> show schemas;
mysql> use usermgmt;
mysql> show tables;
mysql> select * from users;
```

## Step-06: Clean-Up
- Delete all k8s objects created as part of this section
```
# Delete All
kubectl delete -f kube-manifests/

# List Pods
kubectl get pods

# Verify sc, pvc, pv
kubectl get sc,pvc,pv
```
